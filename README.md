# For-IMC

Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to work on this coding test.

I read all of your coding guidelines. Many of these guidelines resonated strongly with my own ideas 
about best practices. The guidelines are in some cases more nuanced than my personal understanding. 
I very much appreciate the effort put in to compile the information along with all the links to examples. 
I am very impressed with the standards, and would love the opportunity to work with a group of developers 
so dedicated to improving their craft. If I have made mistakes in my implementation I would very much 
appreciate it if you point them out to me. If you do not choose to hire me, please let me know why. 
I took this test very seriously, and gave it my best effort.

I thought it was a very well designed test.

If hired I will do my best every day, and would welcome your collaboration to improve my craft.

Thank you, and please hire me. :)
